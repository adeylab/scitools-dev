The scitools-dev repository is for internal Adey Lab usage only.

Two versions will be maintained:
  scitools-dev  is designed to include functions that are unstable and under active development
  scitools      is for all stable functions - it should be replaced by scitools-dev once new stable functions are established

Note: This structure is subject to change - we may just maintain one version once everyone is comfortable with branching... baby steps...
